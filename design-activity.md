- What classes does each implementation include? Are the lists the same?
    - Implementation A includes the following classes:
        - CartEntry
        - ShoppingCart
        - Order
    - Implementation B include the same classes.
- Write down a sentence to describe each class.
    - CartEntry: Keeps track of individual items added to cart.
    - ShoppingCart: Keeps track of cartful of items. 
    - Order: Calculates price of purchasing cartful of items.
- How do the classes relate to each other? It might be helpful to draw a diagram on a whiteboard or piece of paper.
    - An Order contains one ShoppingCart.
    - A ShoppingCart contains many CartEntry(s). 
- What **data** does each class store? How (if at all) does this differ between the two implementations?
    - Implementation A: 
        - CartEntry stores unit_price and quantity
        - ShoppingCart stores entries
        - Order stores SALES_TAX, cart, and total_price (and price of a single cart entry, although not explicitly stored)
    - Implementation B: 
        - CartEntry stores unit_price, quantity, and price (of single CartEntry)
        - ShoppingCart stores entries and price (sum of all entries)
        - Order stores SALES_TAX, cart, and total_price
- What **methods** does each class have? How (if at all) does this differ between the two implementations?
    - Implementation A: 
        - They all have initialize methods, and Order has a total_price method.
    - Implementation B:
        - They all have initialize methods, and they all have different price methods.
- Consider the `Order#total_price` method. In each implementation:
    - Is logic to compute the price delegated to "lower level" classes like `ShoppingCart` and `CartEntry`, or is it retained in `Order`?
    - Does `total_price` directly manipulate the instance variables of other classes?
        - Implementation A:
            - The logic to compute the price is not delegated to "lower level" classes
            - total_price directly manipulates the instance variables of other classes
        - Implementation B:
            - The logic to compute price is delegated to "lower level" classes
            - total_price does not directly manipulate the instance variables of other classes
- If we decide items are cheaper if bought in bulk, how would this change the code? Which implementation is easier to modify?
    - In this case, we would want to change the unit price of a CartEntry depending on the quantity. This would be easier to do in Implementation B's CartEntry#price method.
- Which implementation better adheres to the single responsibility principle?
    - Implementation B
- Bonus question once you've read Metz ch. 3: Which implementation is more loosely coupled?
    - Implementation B

- Changes to Hotel
    - Move validate_size to Block
        - Make max_rooms a constant
    - Date validation -- where to? (Interval/DateRange class? Parent class for Block & Reservation?)
    - Move create_block logic to Block (tough bc coupled)

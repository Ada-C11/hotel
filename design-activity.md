What classes does each implementation include? Are the lists the same? | The classes are three classes in each implementation: CartEntry, ShoppingCart, Order. 
Write down a sentence to describe each class. | CartEntry keeps track of the unit price and quantity for an item. Shopping cart is an array of items in the first implementation, and in the second it is an array of items and can keep track of total cost pre-tax for all items in the cart. Order is where an individual shopping cart is instantiated and the total price for an order including tax is calculated. 
How do the classes relate to each other? | An Order has one ShoppingCart (1:1),  and a shopping cart is composed of a collection of CartEntries (one to many). 
What data does each class store? | In the first implementation, CartEntry initializes price and quantity, Shopping cart is just an array of CartEntries and finally in Order, the Law of Demeter is being "violated" because of how closely coupled the prior two classes are. Order knows too much about the other classes and any changes in them would break Order. In the second implementation, CartEntry has knowledge of the price for each entry, shopping car has a way to return the price of a cart and then Order is more loosely coupled and can caluclate the total price for a ShoppingCart object. 
What methods does each class have? | First implementation: Only one method in Order, second, each class has a method to manipulate it's own data, and not the data of the other classes. 
Consider the `Order#total_price` method | In the first implementation it is directly manipulating the instance variables of other classes, whereas the second implementation delegates the work to the lower classes. total_price in the first does directly manipulate, and in the second it does not. 
If we decide items are cheaper if bought in bulk, how would this change the code? Which implementation is easier to modify? | It would mean that the price would change, and is easier to implement in the second one because we could add a method to CartEntry that accounts for bulk pricing. One change vs multiple needed changes to the first implementation. 
Which implementation better adheres to the single responsibility principle? | The second one. 
Bonus question once you've read Metz ch. 3: Which implementation is more loosely coupled? | The second one!

#### Hotel Revisited Activity
I could see now (was much harder for me to see at the time of designing) that my code was loosely coupled. What I now know was challenging for me to decipher was what behavior a class should have/what is it's responsibility. So I had classes with single responsibility but with duplicated behavior (methods). Primarily, I had a room which was handling dates (rooms aren't dates) and reservations that relied on the RoomBooker to handle dates - I didn't see the clear relationship between Reservation being a kind of DateRange - even though I had those two classes there. My room class was repeated behavior that wasn't clear why it was doing so, why were Rooms checking their date overlaps when I could do that from within a reservation... I missed the WHAT is my class doing and I will take this learning with me. Thank you for the feedback and for the example of how to do this project in a very streamlined way.

1. need to add a reservation class that will take responsibility over making reservations
- want to keep hotel_ledger tracking all reservations (date conflicts, availability)
- will need to add reservation block method to this class

2. need to figure out reservation blocks, maybe with user name? to access these blocks.
- be able to reserve from these blocks
- validate dates, calculate total

3. add a room class?
- for future if room prices change depending on room number or room numbers increase to greater than 20

 Practice to keep track of thoughts 
 - First I wanted to do a date-management kind of class, then thoughts
 changed (it seemed more complicated while writing the code)
 - From feedback going to implement few changes, maybe room class
 is not longer needed 
 - to resolve the blocking could create another class
 - could also do StandardError inheritance

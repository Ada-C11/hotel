To refactor this code, I'd make sure all methods have validation checks for all arguments that get passed in. I'd also write more tests for room and reservation, and write tests for all overlapping date possibilities we discussed in class. Code may just need some general DRY attention as well. I could also look through at the variable naming and method naming conventions and create more of a standard style. Revisit if there are any methods that could belong to the Hotel Block class.

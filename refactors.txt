1. ADD MORE TESTS.
2. Refactor existing tests.
3. Refactor overlap methods in block and reservation to handle both dates and date ranges
4. Many classes have similar methods. Try to implement an inheritance relationship with an abstract class.
5. Find more class-specific methods (like add_res_to_block and add_res_to_room) that I can combine with duck typing
6. Convert things to keyword args when possible
7. See where I can make composition one-way (most of my composition relationships are currently 2-way)
8. Try to implement CSV capabilities? (optional prompt #2)

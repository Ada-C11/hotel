1. reduce dependencies within the ReservationManager class by creating more 
helper methods within the class, and also in the Room & Reservation classes

2. refactor to somehow make attr_writer for booking_name in Reservation class
private??

3. I have a feeling that the code would be cleaner if I used Date ranges instead
of arrays of dates...even though I started with Date ranges and switched to 
arrays, and now I want to switch back. huff.

4. Do you need the Room Class? Can it be eliminated?

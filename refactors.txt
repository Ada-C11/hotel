1. My methods to calculate the total reservation cost are not integrated into the reservation, so technically it can only calculate the cost when you call the method on a reservation. Right now, I think this should be automatically calculated when making a reservation or blocking a room. 
2. The date parsing is all over the place. In some places it's in my .lib file and in others it's in my .spec file. These should all be changed to assume that the date is not a string and use Date.new in my tests. Passed parameters in the .lib file should not include any reference to the Date class.
3. I might also include another parameter in the Reservations so that it indicates where the room is reserved or blocked. Then when you want to search for available rooms, it will be cleaner. Also when changing the blocked room to a reservation, you just need to change the parameter from blocked to reserved. You could also see all reserved and blocked rooms for a specific time period altogether.

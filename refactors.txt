1.  Maybe it isn't necessary to use the 'list_available_rooms' method in 'reserve_rooms' for Hotel::Manager.
    Consider iterating over @rooms with 'is_available?', and breaking the loop at the first available room.

2.  Manager, Reservation and Rooms are currently tightly coupled.  Consider making wrapper methods that
    isolate the creation of new Reservation and Room instances.

3.  Is "Block" just another type of Reservation?  Consider making Block a child of Reservation.

4.  Make test dates for specs more consistent (currently some key off of the Date gem, others are set strings)

5.  Consider setting a cap to how far into the future one can make a reservation.

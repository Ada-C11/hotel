Changes that could be made:
- naming conventions, etc.
- Add functionality for actual ranges (___...___) for date parameters
- Create more helper methods?? (Room availability error, e.g.)
- Clarify when a constant is used and when a number is hard-coded
    - Especially important if standard rate or number of rooms change, for example.
- Where are my custom errors supposed to be defined?
- Maybe: Move some functionality from FrontDesk to others while preserving loose coupling

Refactor hotel.rb
    1) Create custom exception for invalid reservations.
        HotelError added
    2) Consider using .map instead of .each for the "list_reservations_by_date_range" method.
        Didn't use .map, but used .select instead
    3) Use module as a namespace 
        Added namespace 


Refactor hotel_spec.rb
    1) Reorganize tests by using an additional describe layer and splitting the tests up by hotel methods.


Refactor reservation.rb
    1) Find a way to remove "nights = nights.to_i" line.
        Removed
    2) Find a way to remove "total_cost = nights * @rate" line.
        This is not needed

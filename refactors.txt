1 - I would like to make a Room class because although it is unnecessary for this
project I think it would lend itself to greater future proofing as new rooms could
be added with new attributes as well (like cost differences)

2 - Test data read from a CSV file could have been more thorough and led to better
tests

3 - I'm not sure that I like Calendar being a separate module but I'm not sure how
to better rework it

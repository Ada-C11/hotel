Having list_all_rooms method in the Room class might restrict hotel instances with different number of rooms. 
Need to create a helper class for hotel_dispatcher helper methods such as list_reserved_rooms, list_block_rooms, and list_block_reserved_rooms. 
Replace each methods with map and other enumerable methods, so the code looks cleaner. 
Rename some variables and method names to make it easier to understand. 
Use let in spec files to DRY the test.

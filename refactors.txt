Changes that I could make:
    1. Simplify my algorithm to my get_na_objects method in the ReservationManager class: 
        Currently this class contains a long code of comparison operators. I could make it
        shorter and more simple, making it easier to understand and to change for later use.
    2. Simplify my self.validate_date method in DateRange class. There are a lot of Raise ArgumentErrors
        statements. I think I could shorten them using another logic, or use StandardError.
    3. DRY out my code. The code in most of my methods are long, thus reducing readability.
        For example, my find_available_rooms method in the ReservationManager
        class is long. It could be more simplified.

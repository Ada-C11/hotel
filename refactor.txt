1. Consider renaming reservation_array, blocked_rooms_array, and blocked_reservation_array something clear that does not include "array"
2. Work on logic in make_block_reservation method (possibly adjust view_available_rooms method and use that like I do in make_reservation method
3. Reservation class and ReservationManager class are fairly tightly coupled, 
    a. Investigate feeding in instance of Reservation into ReservationManager instead of instantiating it in the class. 
    b. The logic for sorting through arrays of instances of Reservation (reservation_array and blocked_reservation_array) in ReservationManager involves using .room, .duration, etc from Reservation class. I think that this also makes it more tightly coupled. Think about how to adjust this. 
4. Limit keyword arguments to what they are necessary for - it doesn't make a lot of sense to have a default for end and start date, a reservation should *always* be instantiated with one, and if the user doesn't enter one, it's better to raise an error than assume a start date of today and an end date of tomorrow 
5. DRY up tests by using more let

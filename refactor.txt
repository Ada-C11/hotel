Future changes
1. Make sure each class has a id parameter(possibly randomly created for reservations so that they each have a unique id)
2. standardize arrive_day and first_day/ depart_day and last_day variable names throughout classes, so naming is consistent 
3. refactor tests so that all dates are held in variables, so that there are no random dates in the tests. this should give more clarity
4. Add test cases where dates are entered in different formats, Raise argument error if they are in improper formats
find a way to further minimize dependancies, not sure what yet.
5. Add more test cases to hotel create block
6.
